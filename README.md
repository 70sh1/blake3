About this fork
---------
This repo, https://github.com/glycerine/blake3 , is a fork of 
lukechampine.com/blake3 (https://github.com/lukechampine/blake3) 
that adds accelerated hashing using multiple parallel goroutines.

The added function is called`HashFile()` https://github.com/glycerine/blake3/blob/master/parallel.go#L40 . It is found
in parallel.go. Tests are in parallel_test.go.

If/when the same changes are applied upstream,
in https://github.com/lukechampine/blake3/pull/24
then this fork will no longer be necessary.

Until then, users like myself who need this fuctionality
can import this fork. It is used, for example, in my `b3`
tool https://github.com/glycerine/b3 ; the Golang equivalent
of the Rust b3sum command line provided by the Blake3
project https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3 . You
can use `b3 -hex -f` to verify they produce the same hashes.

`blake3` implements the [BLAKE3 cryptographic hash function](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3).
This implementation aims to be performant without sacrificing (too much)
readability, in the hopes of eventually landing in `x/crypto`.

In addition to the pure-Go implementation, this package also contains AVX-512
and AVX2 routines (generated by [`avo`](https://github.com/mmcloughlin/avo))
that greatly increase performance for large inputs and outputs.

## Benchmarks

Tested on a 2020 MacBook Air (i5-7600K @ 3.80GHz). Benchmarks will improve as
soon as I get access to a beefier AVX-512 machine. :wink:

## Shortcomings

There is no assembly routine for single-block compressions. This is most
noticeable for ~1KB inputs.

Each assembly routine inlines all 7 rounds, causing thousands of lines of
duplicated code. Ideally the routines could be merged such that only a single
routine is generated for AVX-512 and AVX2, without sacrificing too much
performance.
